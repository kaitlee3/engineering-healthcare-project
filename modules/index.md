# Modules

Welcome to the modules page! Here you can explore various topics and learning materials related to engineering in healthcare.

## Biomechanics
Learn how engineering principles are applied to understand the mechanics of the human body and develop rehabilitation devices.
- **Topics:** Human movement, joint mechanics, gait analysis, assistive devices
- **Resources:** [Intro to Biomechanics](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/humanbiomechanics/chapter/1-0-introduction-2/), [Research Papers](https://cellandbioscience.biomedcentral.com/?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=22216060248&gbraid=0AAAAApIOJzpPpL8_mH4DfmFItHs5r6Vgp&gclid=CjwKCAjwobnGBhBNEiwAu2mpFNPV9qwxgnY-XId1UI2p2k6Ubz1GEaFOLIY1ovlt0NUdoE1KiaB9WRoC0bYQAvD_BwE)

## Prosthetics
Explore the design and engineering of artificial limbs and devices that restore function to patients.
- **Topics:** Artificial limbs, materials, control systems, patient care
- **Resources:** [Prosthetic Design Basics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/prosthesis-design)

## Physics of Medical Imaging
Discover how physics is used to create images of the body for diagnosis and treatment.
- **Topics:** X-rays, MRI, CT scans, ultrasound, image processing
