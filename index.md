# Engineering & Healthcare Project

Welcome! This is my mini project exploring how engineering is revolutionizing the healthcare system.

## Engineering in Healthcare
Technology is revolutionizing healthcare, and engineers are at the heart of the change. Healthcare systems engineers combine data, innovation, and systems thinking to improve how care is delivered. From reducing hospital wait times to helping doctors focus on prevention, these engineers are creating smarter, more efficient healthcare solutions. As the industry evolves, their role is essential in building a healthier future for all.

## Personal Statement 
My passion for engineering and healthcare comes from a deep interest in both science and helping people. I've always been fascinated by how the human body works--and equally inspired by the ways technology can solve real world problems. As our healthcare system grows more complex, I want inspire and be part of the next generation of engineers who create smarter, more compassionate, and more accessible solutions for everyone. This project is my first step into discovering meaningful ways to make a difference in people's lives.
