# About

## About Me
Hi! I’m Kaitlyn, and I’m deeply interested in the STEM field — particularly biomedical engineering. My journey began with an interest in medicine, inspired by my grandfather. Over time, I discovered my true passion in physics and mathematics, and how they can be applied to solve real-world problems. Now, I’m excited about combining these fields to make a difference in biomedical engineering and beyond.
