# Engineering Innovations in Healthcare
Engineering is transforming healthcare in many ways. Here are a few examples:

- **Medical Imaging:** Engineers develop MRI, CT, and X-ray machines to help doctors see inside the body.
- **Wearable Devices:** Devices like smartwatches track heart rate and detect arrhythmias.
- **Robotic Surgery:** Surgical robots allow doctors to perform complex procedures with precision.
- **Telemedicine:** Engineers build secure platforms for remote diagnosis and patient care.
- **3D Printing:** Prosthetics and implants can be custom-made using 3D printers.

### Real-World Application

#### [Tommy’s Journey](https://blog.prusa3d.com/father-made-a-3d-printed-arm-for-his-son-four-inspirational-stories-about-how-our-3d-printers-help_8254/): A 3D-Printed Solution for a Young Hero
Tommy Dengel was born without his right hand and much of his arm due to a rare condition called amniotic band syndrome. Traditional prosthetics didn’t suit him, but everything changed when his father, Adam, discovered the potential of 3D printing. Adam began creating assistive devices for Tommy using a 3D printer. Among several designs, Tommy’s favorite was a prosthetic inspired by Buzz Lightyear’s spacesuit—bringing joy and confidence to his daily life.

## How do Medical Devices Work?
- **X-ray Machines:** Use electromagnetic waves to create images of bones and tissues, helping doctors diagnose injuries and diseases.
- **Wearable Health Monitors:** Devices like fitness trackers and smartwatches continuously check vital signs such as heart rate, oxygen levels, and sleep patterns.
- **Robotic Surgery:** Advanced robots assist surgeons in performing precise, minimally invasive operations, improving outcomes and reducing recovery time.

## Public Health Engineering Solutions
- **Water Purification:** Engineering solutions like filtration and UV treatment provide clean, safe drinking water for communities, preventing disease.
- **Low-Cost Diagnostics:** Affordable tools such as rapid blood tests and mobile diagnostic kits make it easier to detect illnesses in resource-limited settings.

## Role of Software and AI in Modern Healthcare
- **Software and AI:** Programs and artificial intelligence analyze medical data, support diagnosis, predict health risks, and personalize patient care.

## Sustainable Engineering in Healthcare
- **Eco-Friendly Hospitals:** Sustainable designs use energy-efficient systems, recycled materials, and smart technology to reduce environmental impact.
- **Solar-Powered Clinics:** Clinics powered by solar panels offer reliable healthcare in remote areas, even where electricity is scarce.
