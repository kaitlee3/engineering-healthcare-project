# Engineering Innovations in Healthcare
Engineering is transforming healthcare in many ways. Here are a few examples:

- **Medical Imaging:** Engineers develop MRI, CT, and X-ray machines to help doctors see inside the body.
- **Wearable Devices:** Devices like smartwatches track heart rate and detect arrhythmias.
- **Robotic Surgery:** Surgical robots allow doctors to perform complex procedures with precision.
- **Telemedicine:** Engineers build secure platforms for remote diagnosis and patient care.
- **3D Printing:** Prosthetics and implants can be custom-made using 3D printers.

## Why This Interests Me

I’m fascinated by how technology can improve lives and make healthcare more accessible. I hope to learn more and maybe work on projects that make a difference!

### [Tommy’s Journey](https://blog.prusa3d.com/father-made-a-3d-printed-arm-for-his-son-four-inspirational-stories-about-how-our-3d-printers-help_8254/): A 3D-Printed Solution for a Young Hero
Tommy Dengel was born without his right hand and much of his arm due to a rare condition called amniotic band syndrome. Traditional prosthetics didn’t suit him, but everything changed when his father, Adam, discovered the potential of 3D printing. Partnering with Team UnLimbited, a nonprofit providing custom 3D-printed prosthetic arms, Adam began creating assistive devices for Tommy using an Original Prusa 3D printer. Among several designs, Tommy’s favorite was a prosthetic inspired by Buzz Lightyear’s spacesuit—bringing joy and confidence to his daily life.
