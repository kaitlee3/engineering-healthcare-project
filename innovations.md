# Engineering Innovations in Healthcare
Engineering is transforming healthcare in many ways. Here are a few examples:

- **Medical Imaging:** Engineers develop MRI, CT, and X-ray machines to help doctors see inside the body.
- **Wearable Devices:** Devices like smartwatches track heart rate and detect arrhythmias.
- **Robotic Surgery:** Surgical robots allow doctors to perform complex procedures with precision.
- **Telemedicine:** Engineers build secure platforms for remote diagnosis and patient care.
- **3D Printing:** Prosthetics and implants can be custom-made using 3D printers.

## Why This Interests Me

Iâ€™m fascinated by how technology can improve lives and make healthcare more accessible. I hope to learn more and maybe work on projects that make a difference!
