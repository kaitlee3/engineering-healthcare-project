# Code & Projects

Welcome to my showcase of code snippets, scripts, and hands-on projects related to engineering and healthcare!

## Project

- **Biomedical Engineering Project:** My biomedical engineering project explores the integration of engineering principles with biology to develop innovative solutions that enhance understanding of human health.

## Code Snippets

### MRI Image Enhancement (Python)
```python
import cv2

def enhance_mri(image_path):
    # Load the MRI image
    img = cv2.imread(image_path, 0)
    # Apply histogram equalization for better contrast
    enhanced_img = cv2.equalizeHist(img)
    return enhanced_img
```
Uses OpenCV to improve the contrast of an MRI image, helping clinicians see details more clearly.

Feel free to add more details, screenshots, or explanations for each project!
